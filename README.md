Notifies you on DM when a new episode of your favorite anime comes out on Crunchyroll!

## How does it work?

The bot uses Crunchyroll's RSS feed to get the data, however, we need to know when a new item is added and every 30 seconds it re-checks it (the best time I got to not be banned by Crunchyroll) and see if there is new animes and checks in the database people who have registered to receive notification of this anime.
